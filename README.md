# Hi, this is Aradhana Nayak

Hi, Aradhana here :smile:
<br>
Let's see what the future folds ahead for me :grin:

<h1> ðŸŒŸ Interests</h1>

 - **ðŸ“º No Anime, NO life!** : I love watching anime and have been watching since
   I was 7 year old (*Animax was the first source*)! The most important point in watching anime which I strongly believe is, **ALWAYS WATCH SUBBED**
   
 - **ðŸ“š Manga and Light Novel** : I may not spend maximum of the time in reading manga or LNs but I love reading nonetheless.

 - **ðŸŽ¶ Music** : Mostly J-pop, J-rock, Anisongs, EDMs and bit of K-pop (only *IZ\*ONE* has special place in my heart) 
 - **ðŸ’¥ Other** : I like to write, have a knack in photography ( I wish I owned a DSLR of my own) and also sometimes draw (not really?)
